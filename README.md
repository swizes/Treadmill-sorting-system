# Treadmill-sorting-system
Hamburg University of Applied Sciences Software Engineering 2 Course - Treadmill Sorting System - Spring semester 2015

The outcome of this projects were:

Setting up and commissioning of a sorting system.
The linking of the modeling methods learned in Software Engineering 1 course to an actual hardware.
Collaboration and allocation of tasks in "larger" team structures.
The interaction of soft / hardware developers with customers.

I was responsible for the modelling of the software with Finite-state machine and implementing the interface of the modelled design.
